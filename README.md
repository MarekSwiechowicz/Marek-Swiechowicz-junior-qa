# Project Overview

This repository showcases my skills in setting up and testing REST APIs, particularly in the context of real-time collaboration features. It contains multiple projects and tasks, each organized into specific folders as described below.

## Task Descriptions

1. **CKEditor 5 with Real-Time Collaboration**: A sample integration demonstrating CKEditor 5 configured for real-time collaboration.
2. **Token Endpoint**: A Node.js application providing a JWT token endpoint for authenticating and authorizing CKEditor 5 instances.
3. **REST API Proxy Tool**: A tool for sending requests to CKSource Cloud Services REST API, including request signature generation and handling various endpoints.
4. **REST API Test Cases**: Documented test cases to ensure the proper functionality of Cloud Services REST API endpoints.

## Folder Structure

- `ckeditor5-collaboration-sample/`: Contains the CKEditor 5 with real-time collaboration sample.
- `token-endpoint/`: Contains the Node.js application for the JWT token endpoint.
- `vite-project/`: A project similar to the `ckeditor5-collaboration-sample` but uses a custom token generated by the `token-endpoint` server.
- `rest-api-proxy-tool/`: Contains the tool for sending requests to Cloud Services REST API.
- `test-cases.pdf`: Document with test cases for REST API endpoints.

## Detailed Description

### ckeditor5-collaboration-sample/

This folder contains the HTML and JavaScript code for a sample CKEditor 5 setup with real-time collaboration features. The sample includes:

- A working editor with a sidebar and presence list.
- Configuration for real-time collaboration using CKSource Cloud Services.

### token-endpoint/

This folder includes a Node.js application that provides a JWT token endpoint. The server:

- Runs on TCP port 1337.
- Generates and returns a valid JWT for each GET request to authenticate and authorize CKEditor 5 instances.

### vite-project/

This folder contains a project similar to the `ckeditor5-collaboration-sample` but configured to use a custom token generated by the `token-endpoint` server. It demonstrates:

- The integration of CKEditor 5 with real-time collaboration using custom token authentication.

### rest-api-proxy-tool/

This folder contains a Node.js application that acts as a proxy tool for interacting with the CKSource Cloud Services REST API. The application:

- Runs on TCP port 9001.
- Implements request signature generation for secure API communication.
- Supports various endpoints such as flushing documents, retrieving users, comments, and suggestions.
- Allows interaction with documents created in the CKEditor 5 sample.

### test-cases.pdf

This PDF document provides detailed test cases for each REST API endpoint handled by the proxy tool. The test cases:

- Verify the proper functionality and data accuracy of the Cloud Services REST API.
- Include scenarios to test endpoints like flushing documents, retrieving users, comments, and suggestions.

## How to Run the Applications

### CKEditor 5 Collaboration Sample

1. Open the `ckeditor5-collaboration-sample/index.html` file in your browser to see CKEditor 5 in action.

### Token Endpoint

1. Navigate to the `token-endpoint/` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
